  - [X] impl Default
- [X] struct AfterMount<Mdl> defer to run changes for this problem
  - [X] fn new
  - [X] fn url_handling
- [X] trait IntoAfterMount<Ms, Mdl, IntoNodes<Ms>, GMs>
  - [X] impl for F - sticking point is [[file:src/app.rs::let app_init_cfg]]

*** DONE before_mount.rs
- [X] trait MountPoint: deleted
- [X] enum MountType: Run into non trivial problems
  - [X] default: can go without deriving Default
*** DONE init.rs
- [X] struct Init<Mdl>
  - [X] fn new: only in tests, and is todo item to fix that
*** PROJ build a plan on how to make this all work
