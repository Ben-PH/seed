* PROJ Clearing out the builder module
** DONE Revert clippy lints file:src/lib.rs::future_not_send
** DONE move run into start
** DONE Change test code to use a test-module defined init function instead of inline closure
** DONE verify that all remaining builde/*.rs code is not easily culled
*** DONE after_mount.rs
- [X] enum UrlHandling - Possible to refactor UrlHandling to Option<PassToRoutes>
  - [X] impl Default
- [X] struct AfterMount<Mdl> defer to run changes for this problem
  - [X] fn new
  - [X] fn url_handling
- [X] trait IntoAfterMount<Ms, Mdl, IntoNodes<Ms>, GMs>
  - [X] impl for F - sticking point is [[file:src/app.rs::let app_init_cfg]]

*** DONE before_mount.rs
- [X] trait MountPoint: deleted
- [X] enum MountType: Run into non trivial problems
  - [X] default: can go without deriving Default
*** DONE init.rs
- [X] struct Init<Mdl>
  - [X] fn new: only in tests, and is todo item to fix that
** PROJ build a plan on how to make this all work
**** DONE Drep use of `e_mountrInit` in test code and clear `init.rs`
**** DONE IntoAfterMount in before_mount is problematic in `App::start`
- we make a Box<|self, url, OrdersContainer| -> AfterMount>
- `init` is the same type as what start gets
- the result of the init calls `url_handling`, which casts
- AfterMount is just a model, and whether or not it's PassToRoutes
**** DONE MountType in before_mount
***** replaced with a boolean named "takeover"
